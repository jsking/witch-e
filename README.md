WITCH-E Project
=========

Repository for a web based emulator for the Harwell
WITCH. The Harwell computer, later known as the Wolverhampton Instrument for
Teaching Computing from Harwell (WITCH), or the Harwell Dekatron Computer,
was an early British relay-based computer. It has been restored and on
display at The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park, where it
is described as "the oldest original functioning electronic stored program
computer in the world".

The programming manual is located at http://www.tnmoc.org/special-projects/harwell-dekatron-witch/programmers-manual
